# Privacy Policy — AppleHealth to GitHub
Effective Date: February 23, 2026

AppleHealth to GitHub ("the App") is designed to read your Apple Health data locally on your device and, only when you explicitly choose, export that data to a GitHub repository you configure.

## Data We Collect
- **Health data:** The App reads selected Apple Health data types locally on your device. This data is **not collected by the developer** and is not transmitted anywhere unless you explicitly export it to GitHub.
- **Crash data:** The App receives **Apple Crash Reports** to improve stability. No third-party crash or analytics SDKs are used.

## How We Use Data
- Health data is used **only to display your history and prepare exports** you initiate.
- Crash data is used **only to diagnose and fix issues**.

## Data Sharing
- **GitHub (optional, user-initiated):** When you configure a GitHub repository and press Export, the App sends the selected data to the GitHub API. This is the App’s primary purpose.
- **No other third parties:** The App does not share data with any other services.

## Data Storage
- **On device only:** App settings (e.g., GitHub owner/repo/token, selected data types, export range) are stored locally on your device.
- The App **does not use any developer-controlled servers** and does not upload data anywhere except GitHub when you explicitly export.

## Accounts and Sign‑In
- The App **does not require accounts** and has **no sign-in**.

## Your Choices and Controls
- You choose which Health data types to allow.
- You choose when to export data to GitHub.
- You can revoke Health permissions anytime in iOS Settings.

## Children
- The App is intended for users **16+** with technical expertise. It is not directed to children.

## Tracking, Ads, and Analytics
- The App **does not use ads, analytics, or tracking**.
